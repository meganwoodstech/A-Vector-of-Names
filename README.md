# A-Vector-of-Names
This was for my Chapter 4 Assignment for my C++ Class

Assignment Instructions:

Your assignment is to build a vector of names that the user can edit using iterators.
The user should be able to:

add a name
change a name
remove a name
list names
quit


Pseudocode
/*  
    cout << "This week's homework.n\";
    vector names
    vector::iterator changeIter;
    vector::const_iterator readIter;
    string userInput;
            // list names
    do {
        // give the player their options
        // ask player what they want to do.
        // get player input
        // if(add name)
            // ask "What name?"
            // get input
            // add name to vector
        // else if(change name)
            // what name to change?
            // get input from player
            // look for that name
            // if found
                // change name to what?
                // get input from player
                // old name = new name
            // else
                // say "i didn't find that name"
        // else if(remove name)
            // what name to remove?
            // get input from player
            // if found
                // remove name
            // else
                // say "i didn't find that name"
        // else if(show names)
            // sort names
            // for loop to show every name
            // use iterators and dereference operator
        // else if(quit)
            // break out of loop
        // else
            // that's not one of the options!
    } while(userInput != "Quit" || userInput != "quit");
    // thank user
    // end program
